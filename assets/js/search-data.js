        description: "Diffusion models have transformed generative modeling, powering breakthroughs like Stable Diffusion in images and Sora in video. Yet despite their success, diffusion models share a key limitation - spectral bias; they learn broad, low-frequency structure well but struggle to recover fine, high-frequency details. This happens because the standard uniform noise schedule adds the same Gaussian noise to every frequency band, even though real datasets have very different frequency characteristics. When high-frequency components are overwhelmed with noise early in the forward process, the model learns to regenerate them last, and often poorly leading to the blurred textures and softened edges we observe in many diffusion outputs. Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS) offers a potential way to address this limitation. Instead of treating all frequencies equally, FANS dynamically reshapes the noise distribution based on the true frequency importance of the dataset. This simple yet principled modification plugs directly into existing DDPM architectures and improves denoising where it matters most. Across synthetic datasets (with controlled spectral properties) and real-world benchmarks—including CIFAR-10, CelebA, Texture, and MultimodalUniverse—FANS consistently outperforms vanilla DDPMs, with sharper high-frequency details, lower FID, higher PSNR on reconstruction tasks, and marked gains on texture-rich domains (e.g., up to significant relative improvements in perceptual sharpness and detail fidelity). And crucially, it achieves these benefits without sacrificing performance on standard natural-image datasets.",

We start by explaining technical implementations of such conversions and their strengths. We then perform evaluation on long context understanding benchmarks that are more challenging than those used in prior works, with the objective to better analyze how these methods work or fail.

We argue that some truths are fundamentally inaccessible because they cannot be expressed in language, cannot be inferred from observable data, or cannot be reached by gradient-based training dynamics. Through thought experiments and concrete probes, the post shows how representational limits, identifiability barriers, and optimization constraints create predictable blind spots in model behavior. Understanding this shadow is essential for building safer systems, designing better benchmarks, and avoiding misplaced confidence in model outputs.

However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

        description: "Reinforcement Learning (RL) represents a powerful framework for solving sequential decision-making problems in dynamic environments across diverse domains, such as control of robots or optimization of profit. However, its practical implementation requires navigating a variety of software packages, encompassing deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX/Flax), environment frameworks (e.g., Gymnasium, Numpy), and hyperparameter optimization techniques and libraries. This post critically evaluates the common PyTorch, Gymnasium, and NumPy RL stack by comparing it to a faster alternative:JAX/Flax for both of model training and environment simulation. A Gridworld example evaluating both training speed and accuracy is utilized to test each of these packages. Additionally, we complement our example by a comprehensive tracking and monitoring of the training process using MLflow along with a thorough hyperparameters optimization via Optuna. The post concludes with a discussion of the results and final recommendations for optimal use cases of each of these packages.",

        description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought about a significant change in the field of artificial intelligence, where they have transitioned in scope from being specialized research tools to common resources that drive the next generation of software. With increasing model parameters and training data, LLMs demonstrate new abilities in reasoning, code generation, and solving complex problems that were once considered unattainable. However, scaling these models effectively for long-context applications uniquely poses a challenge. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic time complexity. This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used in token computation, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the entire attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or sparse version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

While theoretically principled, online RLVR remains computationally prohibitive due to tight coupling of generation and optimization, which inflates memory and severely limits training throughput. We prove this gap is architectural, not fundamental. Online RLVR can be reformulated exactly as offline supervised fine-tuning with importance-weighted samples. We introduce Decoupled Generation &amp; Optimization (DGO), a two-phase paradigm that separates generation from optimization, reducing peak memory by ~18-31% and training time by ~75-85% while enabling multi-epoch training. Our framework unifies existing offline methods, exposes systematic theory-practice mismatches, and establishes DGO as the first method where theoretical optimal weights align perfectly with implementation. We show scaling online RLVR is achievable when done right, through principled decoupling and theoretically-grounded design.",

How does the reverse process invert the forward process to generate data from pure noise? 2. How can ODE-based and SDE-based diffusion models be unified under a single framework? 3. Why are diffusion models theoretically superior to ordinary VAEs? 4. How can Denoising, Score Matching, and Flow Matching training objectives be unified and derived from first principles?

We examine how local edits differ from global ones, why forgetting resembles suppression rather than deletion, and how repeated modifications can change a model’s identity. By framing model editing as a philosophical and structural question rather than a purely technical procedure, this piece highlights the need to evaluate edits not only for local correctness but also for their impact on coherence, ontology, and long-term behavior.",

        description: "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more powerful and autonomous, they increasingly face conflicts and dilemmas in many scenarios. We first summarize and taxonomize these diverse conflicts. Then, we model the LLM&#39;s preferences to make different choices as a priority graph, where instructions and values are nodes, and the edges represent context-specific priorities determined by the model&#39;s output distribution. This graph reveals that a unified stable LLM alignment is very challenging, because the graph is not static in different contexts. Besides, it also reveals a potential vulnerability: priority hacking, where adversaries can craft deceptive contexts to manipulate the graph and bypass safety alignments. To counter this, we propose a runtime verification mechanism, enabling LLMs to query external sources to ground their context and resist manipulation. While this approach enhances robustness, we also acknowledge that many ethical and value dilemmas are philosophically irreducible, posing an open challenge for the future of AI alignment.",

This has been interpreted as evidence that models &#39;flexibly manipulate their representations&#39; to reflect in-context semantics, and that this reorganization enables task performance. We offer a simpler mechanistic explanation. We first observe that task performance can be fully explained by induction circuits (Olsson et al., 2022), and show that ablating the attention heads that comprise these circuits substantially degrades performance. As for the geometric structure, we propose that it could result from previous token heads effectively mixing the representations of graph neighbors together. We show that a single round of such &#39;neighbor mixing&#39; on random embeddings recreates the observed graph correspondence in PCA visualizations. These results suggest that apparent &#39;representation reorganization&#39; may be a byproduct of the model&#39;s induction circuits, rather than a critical strategy useful for in-context learning.",

I argue that diffusion&#39;s destroying approach to withholding is more flexible than typical hand-crafted information withholding techniques, providing a rich training playground that could be advantageous in some settings, notably data-scarce ones. I then address subtle issues that may arise when porting reinforcement learning techniques to the diffusion context, and wonder how such exploration problems could be addressed in more diffusion-native ways. I do not have definitive answers, but I do point my fingers in directions I deem interesting. A tutorial follows this thesis, expanding on the destroy-then-generate perspective.

We are used to benchmarking models on massive data sets with well-defined, comparable metrics. But modern AI-generated science is now judged on only a small number of long, open-ended research outputs, making traditional notions of generalization hard to verify. In the absence of standard evaluation frameworks, researchers find themselves creating case-specific evaluation criteria. This blog is a wake-up call, a look at how quickly LLM-based scientific agents are outgrowing our inherited evaluation paradigms, and why we must rethink our long-held assumptions to build rigorous and standardized ways of assessing this new form of AI-driven scientific work.",

This shaped retrieval systems to optimize for finding and ranking more relevant documents, but not keeping results clean and minimal, as the human was the final filter. However, LLMs have changed that by lacking this filtering ability. To address this, we introduce Bits-over-Random (BoR), a chance-corrected measure of retrieval selectivity that reveals when high success rates mask random-level performance.",

To address this inconsistency, the judge prompt is calibrated to align with known, trusted cases. The problem? Manual calibration is time-consuming and error-prone. In this blog post, we explore auto-calibration techniques inspired by recent prompt-optimization research. We tackle context collapse by iteratively processing data in batches, similarly to a machine learning training pipeline. Along the way, we share some surprising findings about what works and what doesn&#39;t—including cases where simpler approaches outperform more sophisticated ones.",
